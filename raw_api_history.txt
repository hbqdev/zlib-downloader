Mostly because the manipulators themselves are true masters of emotional disguise. More often than not, their sweet talking covers their self-serving, dishonest, and, on the whole, sinister intentions. On top of this confusing mismatch of words and actions, they often try to evoke in their interlocutor powerful feelings of guilt or sympathy, so as to make them more susceptible to manipulation. They can be found anywhere, even in the places we frequent most. It could be your partner, your boss, your neighbor, a co-worker, a distant or close relative, or even a friend. We are talking about people who are masters of certain manipulation techniques and use them to confuse us. Although they are around us, it is not easy to detect these people. Their characteristics and personality traits are not evident. Nobody carries a sign on their foreheads, warning that they are a narcissist or sociopath. This book has all you might need to get ahead in life, economically, emotionally, or even socially. Within this ebook, we go through a variety of topics discussing and analyzing the dark psychology behind manipulation. Luckily, you can keep this from happening to YOU, if you know how... Here's just a small fraction of what this book contains: What dark psychology is and how it is used in the world today. Shockingly effective psychological techniques for manipulating, persuading, and influencing people. The basics of covert emotional situation and manipulations.

Topics include Linux command line basics, filesystems, networking, BASH basics, package management, logging, and the Linux kernel and drivers. If you're getting started along the exciting path of hacking, cybersecurity, and pentesting, Linux Basics for Hackers is an excellent first step. Using Kali Linux, an advanced penetration testing distribution of Linux, you'll learn the basics of using the Linux operating system and acquire the tools and techniques you'll need to take control of a Linux environment. First, you'll learn how to install Kali on a virtual machine and get an introduction to basic Linux concepts. Next, you'll tackle broader Linux topics like manipulating text, controlling file and directory permissions, and managing user environment variables. You'll then focus in on foundational hacking concepts like security and anonymity and learn scripting skills with bash and Python. Practical tutorials and exercises throughout will reinforce and test your skills as you learn how to: - Cover your tracks by changing your network information and manipulating the rsyslog logging utility - Write a tool to scan for network connections, and connect and listen to wireless networks - Keep your internet activity stealthy using Tor, proxy servers, VPNs, and encrypted email - Write a bash script to scan open ports for potential targets - Use and abuse services like MySQL, Apache web server, and OpenSSH - Build your own hacking tools, such as a remote video spy camera and a password cracker Hacking is complex, and there is no single way in.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.<p>The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.<p><i>Deep Learning</i> can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

This has been my daily experience for the past decade and even traders who have tried everything for years without success can make their first profits if the art of trading is explained to them in the right way. However, the keyword “in the right way” is important here.<br>This book focuses on technical analysis, explanation and interpretation of price movements and chart patterns as well as on learning effective, ready-to-use trading strategies. However, it is important to go beyond the usual technical analysis, and to analyze the behavior of traders based on psychological factors and phenomena of mass psychology as well. The price movements on the international financial markets arise because millions of people interact with each other every day. Buying and selling decisions are influenced by emotions and human behavioral patterns.<br>Whether we are looking at a speculator from China 200 years ago, a Wall Street pit trader from New York 80 years ago or a modern-day "Joe Bloggs trader”, trading from his/her smartphone – the human components, i.e. emotions and instincts, hardly differ. Greed, fear, uncertainty and the willingness to take risks have determined human actions for millennia and, of course, also how people have maneuvered their money around the world\'s markets for centuries. Those who learn to read the buyer and seller interaction from the charts will be able to read and handle any price movement. This is true because all price charts follow universal and timeless rules that can be successfully interpreted with the help of effective technical analysis.<br>Over the years, more than one million visitors have already searched for information about trading on our website www.tradeciety.com. Every day, traders ask us how they can understand technical analysis and trading in a better manner. This book is a result of the motivation to answer these questions collectively. It is the book I would have wished for at the beginning of my trading career over 15 years ago.<br>The first section of this book provides comprehensive knowledge of the fundamentals and individual components of technical analysis and price analysis. The second section focuses on the most important trading patterns as well as the correct interpretation of chart formations. We will explore potential entry signal points and trading strategies so that traders can now already make sense of their own charts with confidence. The third and final section focuses on developing a customized trading strategy. In addition to an insight into important psychological trading concepts, traders will get numerous practical tips to ensure that they handle their trading professionally at the end of this book.<br>The goal of this book is it to enable the reader to look behind the price movements and understand why prices rise and fall, how buyers and sellers interact and thus to make effective trading decisions. The comprehensive and step-by-step knowledge of technical analysis ultimately makes it possible to interpret any chart situation and, thus, hopefully, become an independent trader.'}, {'id': 4989093, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Words That Change Minds: The 14 Patterns for Mastering the Language of Influence', 'author': 'Shelle Rose Charvet', 'volume': '', 'year': 2019, 'edition': '3', 'publisher': 'Institute for Influence', 'identifier': '9781733670326,1733670327', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 318, 'series': '', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/ebde05217a396efacd923971d223825329c0e54a84e39cee86f236868d898581.jpg', 'terms_hash': '9c134c4fdaa56901d4c51fe32eacc3a2', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 6882566, 'filesizeString': '6.56 MB', 'extension': 'pdf', 'md5': '3a0e9c4d9b0a3d60cf392b8d24e191f2', 'sha256': '59102e52abff5b22d07479a16dd284a638ddb09dfddf50b46d092d7bfc9adfc2', 'href': '/book/4989093/c5a770/words-that-change-minds-the-14-patterns-for-mastering-the-language-of-influence.html', 'hash': 'c5a770', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': True, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/4989093/6b1c18', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/59102e52abff5b22d07479a16dd284a638ddb09dfddf50b46d092d7bfc9adfc2/4989093/c5a770/words-that-change-minds-the-14-patterns-for-mastering-the-language-of-influence.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=pdf&signature=d977efc0b8f657b2398a4e1ba1b7c732f8e8b94d87740b7e13bf86a566d1cbf9&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F4989093%2F6b1c18', 'date_download': '2022-12-07T11:51:42', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': '<i>Words That Change Minds</i> is based on the Language and Behavior Profle, (LAB Profile® for short)—a powerful tool that enables you to understand, predict and influence behavior by decoding the language people use.<p>You can directly influence people one-on-one, in groups and even in mass communication by customizing your language to match their subconscious Motivation Patterns.<p>Increase your impact, improve relationships and reduce conflicts, by using the <i>Words That Change Minds</i>.&nbsp;<br><p><b>Shele Rose Charvet</b> is a bestselling author and the international expert on influencing language.

Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.</p>'}, {'id': 2855973, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles', 'author': 'Narasimha Karumanchi', 'volume': '', 'year': 2017, 'edition': '', 'publisher': 'CareerMonk Plublications', 'identifier': '9788193245279,819324527X', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 868, 'series': '', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/922a952955ac7c235d5bea952238c9ebecddf2e9e2622ee88a7dd446c2e41547.jpg', 'terms_hash': '41c632dfb6dcf4edc61a6f0f8164174f', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 34326809, 'filesizeString': '32.74 MB', 'extension': 'pdf', 'md5': 'd9a09e7e092770b490569037e38267ec', 'sha256': '1d3d9b446a701d22b86a1da3d83926bb657f9b6bc5d118e103967052a6f78789', 'href': '/book/2855973/a7e557/data-structures-and-algorithms-made-easy-data-structures-and-algorithmic-puzzles.html', 'hash': 'a7e557', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': False, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/2855973/946df4', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/1d3d9b446a701d22b86a1da3d83926bb657f9b6bc5d118e103967052a6f78789/2855973/a7e557/data-structures-and-algorithms-made-easy-data-structures-and-algorithmic-puzzles.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=pdf&signature=61e35f16b12a872f1060b187356e9144595ab364413efa5d1df37cea9456763e&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F2855973%2F946df4', 'date_download': '2023-02-10T10:05:30', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': 'Peeling Data Structures and Algorithms:<br>Table of Contents: goo.gl/JFMgiU<br>Sample Chapter: goo.gl/n2Hk4i<br>Found Issue? goo.gl/forms/4Gt72YO81I<br>Videos: goo.gl/BcHq74<br>"Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles" is a book that offers solutions to complex data structures and algorithms.

This book is a general introduction to machine learning that can serve as a textbook for graduate students and a reference for researchers. It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning while providing the theoretical basis and conceptual tools needed for the discussion and justification of algorithms. It also describes several key aspects of the application of these algorithms. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. Foundations of Machine Learning is unique in its focus on the analysis and theory of algorithms. The first four chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows; subsequent chapters are mostly self-contained. Topics covered include the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework; generalization bounds based on Rademacher complexity and VC-dimension; Support Vector Machines (SVMs); kernel methods; boosting; on-line learning; multi-class classification; ranking; regression; algorithmic stability; dimensionality reduction; learning automata and languages; and reinforcement learning. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Appendixes provide additional material including concise probability review. This second edition offers three new chapters, on model selection, maximum entropy models, and conditional entropy models. New material in the appendixes includes a major section on Fenchel duality, expanded coverage of concentration inequalities, and an entirely new entry on information theory.

Author Marijn Haverbeke keeps the friendly tone and easy-to-follow explanations that made the original a hit, and he adds new exercises for readers to test their skills.&nbsp;<i>Eloquent JavaScript&nbsp;</i>will have readers fluent in the language of the web in no time, eloquently.'}, {'id': 5958524, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Everything You Need to Ace Chemistry in One Big Fat Notebook', 'author': 'Workman Publishing, Jennifer Swanson', 'volume': '', 'year': 2020, 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'publisher': 'Workman Publishing Company', 'identifier': '9781523504251,1523504250', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 519, 'series': 'Big Fat Notebooks', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/0f4ae2d20113d019f5207ab624a7f7214a03e5b81d6facc6ec2b67fdc3f0f5b7.jpg', 'terms_hash': '75d548a823f29ce81ef337b42d4bed89', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 72430350, 'filesizeString': '69.07 MB', 'extension': 'pdf', 'md5': 'e57a74c33e8e0ba2e713c6c277fce215', 'sha256': '0cb86abb913396cd2ad9513b1174b79fdfa9237ac95d3c5c66e1dae90ace6a40', 'href': '/book/5958524/65bd45/everything-you-need-to-ace-chemistry-in-one-big-fat-notebook.html', 'hash': '65bd45', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': False, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/5958524/dd966c', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/0cb86abb913396cd2ad9513b1174b79fdfa9237ac95d3c5c66e1dae90ace6a40/5958524/65bd45/everything-you-need-to-ace-chemistry-in-one-big-fat-notebook.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=pdf&signature=92bfcfb93b685cee3154fa043f07fe5ab79d1d552c521052318b73988694178a&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F5958524%2Fdd966c', 'date_download': '2025-02-13T11:06:09', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': "Chemistry?

Author Al Brooks has done just that. By simplifying his trading system and trading only 5-minute price charts he's found a way to capture profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. His first book, Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar, offered an informative examination of his system, but it didn't allow him to get into the real nuts and bolts of the approach. Now, with this new series of books, Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process. By breaking down his trading system into its simplest pieces: institutional piggybacking or trend trading (the topic of this particular book in the series), trading ranges, and transitions or reversals, this three book series offers access to Brooks' successful methodology. Price Action Trends Bar by Bar describes in detail what individual bars and combinations of bars can tell a trader about what institutions are doing. This is critical because the key to making money in trading is to piggyback institutions and you cannot do that unless you understand what the charts are telling you about their behavior. This book will allow you to see what type of trend is unfolding, so can use techniques that are specific to that type of trend to place the right trades. Discusses how to profit from institutional trading trends using technical analysis Outlines a detailed and original trading approach developed over the author's successful career as an independent trader Other books in the series include Price Action Trading Ranges Bar by Bar and Price Action Reversals Bar by Bar If you're looking to make the most of your time in today's markets the trading insights found in Price Action Trends Bar by Bar will help you achieve this goal."}, {'id': 1130911, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'A Student’s Guide to Fourier Transforms: With Applications in Physics and Engineering (3rd ed. 2011)', 'author': 'J.

Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.<br>Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned.<br>Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.'}, {'id': 5062252, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Financial Freedom : A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need', 'author': 'Vicki Robin; Grant Sabatier', 'volume': '', 'year': 2019, 'edition': 'Ebook', 'publisher': 'Avery Publishing Group', 'identifier': '9780525540885,0525540881', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 340, 'series': '', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/0c14342a9c565ebe23f7dde73483256d5358a2a8b15682662d95d36e134386d4.jpg', 'terms_hash': 'ad8059da6c7aac55a315b029704ece71', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 1887133, 'filesizeString': '1.80 MB', 'extension': 'epub', 'md5': 'a044372a62a360ad3f66bf446540e58d', 'sha256': 'e8b2564ed6393e9535988e8a208b1ac67457c5cd1d95c37b83363ac55f1edfc3', 'href': '/book/5062252/2cafc6/financial-freedom-a-proven-path-to-all-the-money-you-will-ever-need.html', 'hash': '2cafc6', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': True, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/5062252/845207', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/e8b2564ed6393e9535988e8a208b1ac67457c5cd1d95c37b83363ac55f1edfc3/5062252/2cafc6/financial-freedom-a-proven-path-to-all-the-money-you-will-ever-need.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=epub&signature=ae379be9c2b004fd85086ced10b74fce467e9093adc20d3204707c1b9a80d407&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F5062252%2F845207', 'date_download': '2023-06-28T06:42:53', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': '<b>"This book blew my mind.

Five years later, he had a net worth of over $1.25 million, and CNBC began calling him "the Millennial Millionaire." By age 30, he had reached financial independence. Along the way he uncovered that most of the accepted wisdom about money, work, and retirement is either incorrect, incomplete, or so old-school it\'s obsolete.<br><i>Financial Freedom</i>is a step-by-step path to make more money in less time, so you have more time for the things you love. It challenges the accepted narrative of spending decades working a traditional 9 to 5 job, pinching pennies, and finally earning the right to retirement at age 65, and instead offers readers an alternative: forget everything you\'ve ever learned about money so that you can actually live the life you want.<br>Sabatier offers surprising, counter-intuitive advice on topics such as how to:<br><b><br>*</b>Create profitable side hustles that you can turn into passive income streams or full-time businesses<br><b>*</b>Save money without giving up what makes you happy<br><b>*</b>Negotiate more out of your employer than you thought possible<br><b>*</b>Travel the world for less<br><b>*</b>Live for free--or better yet, make money on your living situation<br><b>*</b>Create a simple, money-making portfolio that only needs minor adjustments<br><b>*</b>Think creatively--there are so many ways to make money, but we don\'t see them.<br>But most importantly, Sabatier highlights that, while one\'s ability to make money is limitless, one\'s time is not. There\'s also a limit to how much you can save, but not to how much money you can make. No one should spend precious years working at a job they dislike or worrying about how to make ends meet. Perhaps the biggest surprise: You need less money to "retire" at age 30 than you do at age 65.<br><i>Financial Freedom</i>is not merely a laundry list of advice to follow to get rich quick--it\'s a practical roadmap to living life on one\'s own terms, as soon as possible.</b>'}, {'id': 5583816, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'The Science of Self-Learning: How to Teach Yourself Anything, Learn More in Less Time, and Direct Your Own Education (Learning how to Learn Book 1)', 'author': 'Peter Hollins', 'volume': '1', 'year': 2019, 'edition': '', 'publisher': 'PH Learning Inc.', 'identifier': '', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 202, 'series': 'Learning how to Learn', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/cd6c45c5722839093a9bcde79a04891c0255e5e40f333ee05ba423972c6d3cd3.jpg', 'terms_hash': '3cb3ee371997a5721d797a3c19ebb7f4', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 659083, 'filesizeString': '644 KB', 'extension': 'epub', 'md5': '2ff2e835d45a56f1791e7313c4df0620', 'sha256': 'c7f90d17858d6482c4a06b41b1fb58ccf424fac9b877d927d7331ed2607d5433', 'href': '/book/5583816/c4fe14/the-science-of-selflearning-how-to-teach-yourself-anything-learn-more-in-less-time-and-direct-yo.html', 'hash': 'c4fe14', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': True, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/5583816/463fef', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/c7f90d17858d6482c4a06b41b1fb58ccf424fac9b877d927d7331ed2607d5433/5583816/c4fe14/the-science-of-selflearning-how-to-teach-yourself-anything-learn-more-in-less-time-and-direct-yo.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=epub&signature=c521aa05d2a9e0f57a3b24ab0ce24b997526138b9483b7fbcfd65e29ed187df2&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F5583816%2F463fef', 'date_download': '2023-02-08T09:58:09', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': '<b>How to learn effectively when you have to be <i>both the teacher and student</i>.

Author Al Brooks has done just that. By simplifying his trading system and trading only 5-minute price charts he's found a way to capture profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. His first book, Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar, offered an informative examination of his system, but it didn't allow him to get into the real nuts and bolts of the approach. Now, with this new series of books, Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process. By breaking down his trading system into its simplest pieces: institutional piggybacking or trend trading (the topic of this particular book in the series), trading ranges, and transitions or reversals, this three book series offers access to Brooks' successful methodology. Price Action Trends Bar by Bar describes in detail what individual bars and combinations of bars can tell a trader about what institutions are doing. This is critical because the key to making money in trading is to piggyback institutions and you cannot do that unless you understand what the charts are telling you about their behavior. This book will allow you to see what type of trend is unfolding, so can use techniques that are specific to that type of trend to place the right trades. Discusses how to profit from institutional trading trends using technical analysis Outlines a detailed and original trading approach developed over the author's successful career as an independent trader Other books in the series include Price Action Trading Ranges Bar by Bar and Price Action Reversals Bar by Bar If you're looking to make the most of your time in today's markets the trading insights found in Price Action Trends Bar by Bar will help you achieve this goal."}, {'id': 5351763, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'JavaScript Everywhere: Building Cross-Platform Applications with GraphQL, React, React Native, and Electron', 'author': 'Adam D.

This book introduces the ideas of geometry, and includes a generous supply of simple explanations and examples. The treatment emphasises coordinate systems and the coordinate changes that generate symmetries. The discussion moves from Euclidean to non-Euclidean geometries, including spherical and hyperbolic geometry, and then on to affine and projective linear geometries. Group theory is introduced to treat geometric symmetries, leading to the unification of geometry and group theory in the Erlangen program. An introduction to basic topology follows, with the Möbius strip, the Klein bottle and the surface with g handles exemplifying quotient topologies and the homeomorphism problem. Topology combines with group theory to yield the geometry of transformation groups,having applications to relativity theory and quantum mechanics. A final chapter features historical discussions and indications for further reading. With minimal prerequisites, the book provides a first glimpse of many research topics in modern algebra, geometry and theoretical physics.

In doing so, he continues his lifelong project of demonstrating that our objective, everyday thinking is the lowest rung of a ladder that reaches up to literally infinite heights. The talks in this series and the selections from the question-and-answer sessions on many mathematical topics over the years are translated into English for the first time in The Fourth Dimension.

The latest in the series features 12 new male and female art models--as well as Becca from the previous book--in a collection of poses selected by readers and visitors to the authors' website. The contrast has also been increased in many of the photos to provide deeper, more challenging shadows. While the guide includes individuals and couples with a wide range of body types in natural, relaxed stances as well as some inspired by classical works of art, the primary focus is on dynamic poses--twisting, scrunching, reaching, and even fighting. Poses are precisely lit, revealing every area of the model, and have been carefully chosen to illustrate important effects such as foreshortening and perspective changes.

Have you ever wondered how your GPS can find the fastest way to your destination, selecting one route from seemingly countless possibilities in mere seconds? How your credit card account number is protected when you make a purchase over the Internet? The answer is algorithms. And how do these mathematical formulations translate themselves into your GPS, your laptop, or your smart phone? This book offers an engagingly written guide to the basics of computer algorithms. In Algorithms Unlocked, Thomas Cormen—coauthor of the leading college textbook on the subject—provides a general explanation, with limited mathematics, of how algorithms enable computers to solve problems. Readers will learn what computer algorithms are, how to describe them, and how to evaluate them. They will discover simple ways to search for information in a computer; methods for rearranging information in a computer into a prescribed order (“sorting”); how to solve basic problems that can be modeled in a computer with a mathematical structure called a “graph” (useful for modeling road networks, dependencies among tasks, and financial relationships); how to solve problems that ask questions about strings of characters such as DNA structures; the basic principles behind cryptography; fundamentals of data compression; and even that there are some problems that no one has figured out how to solve on a computer in a reasonable amount of time.'}, {'id': 3554081, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Data Science', 'author': 'John D.

The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems. The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.'}, {'id': 3711505, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Natural Language Processing with PyTorch: Build Intelligent Language Applications Using Deep Learning', 'author': 'Delip Rao, Brian McMahan', 'volume': '', 'year': 2019, 'edition': '1', 'publisher': 'O’Reilly Media', 'identifier': '9781491978238,1491978236', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 210, 'series': '', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/6cc0afb64f4985aa021c90389a113721f5aea2fd94ddb096d1a467a170c7f34a.jpg', 'terms_hash': '8eb67eca001a90b96cfd600722c73fdb', 'active': 0, 'deleted': 1, 'filesize': 16896401, 'filesizeString': '16.11 MB', 'extension': 'pdf', 'md5': 'c49436b0f0bcc70b12a7efd80e4026fc', 'sha256': '04cbf39d02e6cb61d0fde345cc45984f7d0aece6468ffbf9351254e2b906a417', 'href': '/book/3711505/5e4cf3/natural-language-processing-with-pytorch-build-intelligent-language-applications-using-deep-learnin.html', 'hash': '5e4cf3', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': False, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'date_download': '2022-12-11T15:15:29', 'readOnlineAvailable': False, 'description': 'From the Preface<br>This book aims to bring newcomers to natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to a tasting table covering important topics in both areas. Both of these subject areas are growing exponentially. As it introduces both deep learning and NLP with an emphasis on implementation, this book occupies an important middle ground. While writing the book, we had to make difficult, and sometimes uncomfortable, choices on what material to leave out. For a beginner reader, we hope the book will provide a strong foundation in the basics and a glimpse of what is possible. Machine learning, and deep learning in particular, is an experiential discipline, as opposed to an intellectual science. The generous end-to-end code examples in each chapter invite you to partake in that experience.<br>A note regarding the style of the book.<br>We have intentionally avoided mathematics in most places, not because deep learning math is particularly difficult (it is not), but because it is a distraction in many situations from the main goal of this book—to empower the beginner learner.<br>Likewise, in many cases, both in code and text, we have favored exposition over succinctness.

He didn’t learn them in school—who does? Rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources—and here he wants to show others what he’s discovered. Starting with pronunciation, you’ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into familiar sounds. You’ll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using tricks from opera singers and actors. Next, you’ll begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery rather than translations, which will enable you to think in a foreign language. And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, you’ll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in minutes every day. This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and enjoyable way to learn a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.'}, {'id': 655129, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Advanced IQ Tests: The Toughest Practice Questions to Test Your Lateral Thinking, Problem Solving and Reasoning Skills (Testing Series)', 'author': 'Philip Carter', 'volume': '', 'year': 2008, 'edition': 'illustrated edition', 'publisher': 'Kogan Page', 'identifier': '9780749452322,0749452323', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 209, 'series': 'Testing Series', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/af45c88bc7108cc709c4f1fe978e9445d9df99df1581c0bd34c32fa3a02b2398.jpg', 'terms_hash': '98d511041628e72cc8c5e71594ce532b', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 4837051, 'filesizeString': '4.61 MB', 'extension': 'pdf', 'md5': 'd83e8c3fdc22e7726d22be1bea72de35', 'sha256': '495e697d587314c4a6a8d7b16c1b71cd009617343712f8986151b82d6cdd29a4', 'href': '/book/655129/655d2d/advanced-iq-tests-the-toughest-practice-questions-to-test-your-lateral-thinking-problem-solving-an.html', 'hash': '655d2d', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': True, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/655129/8880c5', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/495e697d587314c4a6a8d7b16c1b71cd009617343712f8986151b82d6cdd29a4/655129/655d2d/advanced-iq-tests-the-toughest-practice-questions-to-test-your-lateral-thinking-problem-solving-an.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=pdf&signature=6af8e577b31a12d86970d9c733f9722edac89963ca5383e1dca27ced720fd9b9&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F655129%2F8880c5', 'date_download': '2023-02-08T09:39:26', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': '<i>Advanced IQ Tests</i> is for puzzle lovers who are looking for a challenge.

An understanding of human form is essential for artists to be able to express themselves with the figure. Anatomy makes the figure. <br>No longer will working artists have to search high and low to find the information they need. In this, the most up-to-date and fully illustrated guide available, Eliot Goldfinger — sculptor, illustrator, scientific model-maker, and lecturer on anatomy — presents a single, all-inclusive reference to human form, capturing everything artists need in one convenient volume. Five years in the making, and featuring hundreds of photos and illustrations, this guide offers more views of each bone and muscle than any other book ever published: every structure that creates or influences surface form is individually illustrated in clear, carefully lit photographs and meticulous drawings. Informed by the detailed study of both live models and cadavers, it includes numerous unique presentations of surface structures--such as fat pads, veins, and genitalia--and of some muscles never before photographed. In addition, numerous cross sections, made with reference to CT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and cut cadavers, trace the forms of all body regions and individual muscles. <br>Information on each structure is placed on facing pages for ease of reference, and the attractive two-color format uses red ink to direct readers rapidly to important points and areas. Finally, an invaluable chapter on the artistic development of basic forms shows in a series of sculptures the evolution of the figure, head, and hands from basic axes and volumes to more complex organic shapes.

Along the way, it touches on some of the most essential aspects of this approach, including:<br>•Trading breakouts, which are transitions from trading ranges to trends, and understanding the gaps they create<br>•The two types of "Magnets," Support and Resistance, and what they mean once the market breaks out and begins its move<br>•Pullbacks, which are transitions from trends to trading ranges<br>•The characteristics commonly found in trading ranges—areas of largely sideways price activity—and examples of how to trade them<br>•Honing your order and trade management skills so that you can make more informed entry and exit decisions<br>Throughout the book, Brooks focuses primarily on 5 minute candle charts—all of which are created with TradeStation—to illustrate basic principles, but also discusses daily and weekly charts.

With hundreds of examples commented on in great detail, Volman convincingly points out that only a handful of price action principles are responsible for the bulk of fluctuations in any market session—and that it takes common sense, much more than mastery, to put these essentials to one\'s benefit in the trading game.<br>The power of the book lies in the exceptional transparency with which the concepts and trading techniques are put forth. Besides offering the reader a comprehensive study on price action mechanics, included within is a series of six months of consecutive sessions of the eur/usd 5-minute. Containing nearly 400 fully annotated charts, this section alone harbors a massive database of intraday analysis, not found in any other trading guide.<br>Written with a razor-sharp eye for practical detail, yet in a highly absorbable manner, Understanding Price Action breathes quality from every page and is bound to become a classic in the library of any trader who is serious about his education.<br>About the Author<br>Bob Volman (1961) is an independent trader working solely for his own account. He is the author of Forex Price Action Scalping, a book widely acclaimed by active scalpers for its ingenuity and practical usefulness, and in steady demand since its first publication in 2011. Understanding Price Action is his second volume on price technical trading, containing all the insights and practicalities any trader could ever hope to find within a single trading guide.'}, {'id': 3647669, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Deep Learning with Python: Develop Deep Learning Models on Theano and TensorFLow Using Keras', 'author': 'Jason Brownlee', 'volume': '', 'year': 2016, 'edition': 'v1.7', 'publisher': 'Machine Learning Mastery', 'identifier': '', 'language': 'English', 'pages': 255, 'series': '', 'cover': 'https://s3proxy.cdn-zlib.sk/covers299/collections/genesis/1a4af2546bf5679aea56660fce3ece41c087433afd9d849dc4439ac443c075fe.jpg', 'terms_hash': '44bfa101ab3908dcaf8ce7cf2a620b1a', 'active': 1, 'deleted': 0, 'filesize': 4864872, 'filesizeString': '4.64 MB', 'extension': 'pdf', 'md5': 'a7d1c0b2a05838001e68c723f055e089', 'sha256': '48f4d5dd3b39b87fd61817d1aaeb3b394a8ee065ce887b824de7b86ad9c4d256', 'href': '/book/3647669/84871a/deep-learning-with-python-develop-deep-learning-models-on-theano-and-tensorflow-using-keras.html', 'hash': '84871a', 'kindleAvailable': False, 'sendToEmailAvailable': True, 'interestScore': '5.0', 'qualityScore': '0', 'dl': '/dl/3647669/adf10c', 'readOnlineUrl': 'https://reader.z-library.sk/read/48f4d5dd3b39b87fd61817d1aaeb3b394a8ee065ce887b824de7b86ad9c4d256/3647669/84871a/deep-learning-with-python-develop-deep-learning-models-on-theano-and-tensorflow-using-keras.html?client_key=1fFLi67gBrNRP1j1iPy1&extension=pdf&signature=643c354410a2ec6898793f4d5c2c25c21a5fab93294e2a5b1b5818d19da12b9a&download_location=https%3A%2F%2Fz-library.sk%2Fdl%2F3647669%2Fadf10c', 'date_download': '2023-02-09T10:45:15', 'readOnlineAvailable': True, 'description': None}, {'id': 3355492, 'content_type': 'book', 'title': 'Classical Mechanics', 'author': 'Herbert Goldstein, Charles P.
